# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# Calculation.create(value1: 2, operator: "+", value2: 2, equals: "=", result: 4)

# Calculation.create(value1: 10, operator: "-", value2: 2, equals: "=", result: 8)

# Calculation.create(value1: 5, operator: "*", value2: 2, equals: "=", result: 10)

# Calculation.create(value1: 10, operator: "/", value2: 5, equals: "=", result: 2)
